# Week Planer
Day 1. Think what API is perfect for HackClub (and also learn some react between 22:00 ~ 23:00 if do able)

Day 2. Write an API using NitroJS by Nuxt or Python or Swift (to learn some Swift), preferrely Nitro, but just for the sake for learning, I will use what I can do in the shortest amount of time, since I still need to compelete an App by the end of March and submit it to hack club.

Day 3~5. Make an Basic Application that is useful to my day-to-day usage for iOS and Android.

Day 6. Optimize https://intl.yuanhau.com/

Day 7. Oprimize https://intl.yuanhau.com/ & prepare to have some clases (NOOOOOO) and Start with the basics of the app I want to build, piece-by-piece.
